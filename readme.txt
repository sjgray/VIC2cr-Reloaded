VIC-20 CR Reloaded
==================

This is an early attempt to learn kicad and also to learn how to create an IC library.
This design is for a VIC-20 Cost-reduced version but slightly simplified. It does not
include cassette interface or power components onboard.

This design has not been verified, breadboarded or routed so use at own risk. It is
released as-is and may contain errors.
